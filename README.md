# EDA-EV-Sales-Trend
This project analyzes EV sales data using Tableau, featuring dashboards on top-selling models, year-wise and state-wise trends, CAFV eligibility, and top manufacturers. It provides insights into EV market dynamics and adoption trends, with dashboards available on Tableau Public for exploration and learning.
Analysis of Electric Vehicles (EV) Using Tableau
Overview
This project focuses on performing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Electric Vehicles (EVs) using Tableau. The goal was to extract meaningful insights from raw data about various EV models, their manufacturers, and sales trends over time. The analysis helps in understanding key metrics like top-selling models, regional preferences, eligibility criteria for the Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) program, and other important trends in the EV market.

Data Description
The dataset used in this project contains detailed information about EVs, including:

Car Manufacturers: Brands like Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Tesla, and more.
Models: Various models of EVs and their performance in terms of sales.
Sales Data: Yearly and state-wise sales figures for each EV model.
CAFV Eligibility: Criteria for determining which EVs qualify for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle incentives.
Project Workflow
Raw Data Collection:

Compiled an Excel dataset containing EV sales data, categorized by manufacturers, models, years, states, and eligibility criteria.
Data Visualization in Tableau:

Imported the dataset into Tableau Public to create interactive dashboards and visualizations.
Insights Derived:

Created five major charts to highlight critical insights:
Top 10 Models by Sales: Visualized the most sold EV models across the dataset.
Year-wise Sales Analysis: Tracked sales trends over different years for better understanding of market growth.
State-wise Sales Performance: Highlighted states with the highest EV adoption rates.
CAFV Eligibility Analysis: Analyzed the number of vehicles meeting the CAFV criteria.
Top Manufacturers: Identified manufacturers producing the highest-selling EVs.
Key Features
Interactive Dashboards: The visualizations offer a user-friendly interface to explore the data dynamically.
In-depth Insights: Insights cover sales trends, regional preferences, and manufacturer contributions to the EV market.
Publicly Accessible: Published on Tableau Public for easy sharing and access.
